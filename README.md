# ksTestGUI_Python
This Python GUI is meant to create confidence intervals for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. !WARNING! Only works on Python 2.7 and its associated version of NumPy. If you do not have the appropriate package versions installed, this GUI will generate thousands of .txt and .sh and will not complete the clearing function.
